    -0.5: In a trap-and-emulate virtual machine, the application code is interpreted
          directly by the CPU.  In a dynamic recompilation-based VM, the code
          is indeed interpreted by the VMM (which will translate it into instructions that
          can run without needing to be trapped, though this wasn't clear from your answer.

  b iii) 0 [1 point]

    -1: In a container system, the application runs directly on the CPU.  The
    kernel uses namespaces/control groups to sandbox the application, but doesn't
    need to interpret the application code directly.


3. Practical exercise

    -1: The FROM command sets the base image, so the second FROM doesn't
        add Python to the Ubuntu image, but switches to a new image that
        contains Python (usually Debian).
